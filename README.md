# Control Systems for Self-Driving Cars


**Description**: While on the highway, the monotonous speed
control is a bit tiresome for drivers (especially for long
distances and longer durations). Lane Assist and Adaptive
Cruise Control (ACC) features can help the drivers in these
situations. Depending on the actions of other
objects/vehicles in the car's immediate vicinity, these
systems can slow down and stop the vehicle when required. Robust Control Systems for active speed and steer control are reqquired for efficient closed-loop trajectory tracking and lane centering.

**Specifications**:
- Motion planning and control systems are needed to steer
the vehicle to have the least cross-track error and
automatic lane centering.
